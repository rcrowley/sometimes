NAME
	Sometimes -- a PHP templating system

SYNOPSIS
	require_once 'sometimes.php';
	$doc = html(head(), body(
		h1('Sometimes!'),
		p(array('class' => 'foo'), array('condition' => true), 'Foo bar.')
	));
	$doc->out(array('condition' => true));

DESCRIPTION
	A PHP templating system.  It doesn't play favorites with styles.  Do
	whatever you like.  It supports Smarty-style set-variables-and-then-
	include-a-template and weird templates-call-library-functions-in-place
	styles, among surely others.

	The bonus, though, is when you output HTML, DOM nodes are required to
	meet any arbitrary criteria you set.  Some things are only for Bob?
	Ok.  Some stuff is meant only for unauthenticated users?  Sure.  A
	certain node is never to see the light of day?  Suit yourself.

	It was inspired late one night by Rafe Colburn and takes a page or
	three from _why's Markaby.

INSTALLATION
	It's a PHP file?

	As an aside, I wish there were a good way to checkout and "mix"
	multiple open-source projects together.  Something with symlinks
	and .gitignore files should do the trick.

DEPENDENCIES
	PHP 5 <http://php.net/>
